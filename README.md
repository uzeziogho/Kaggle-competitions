A repo about Kaggle competitions

1 **Titanic**
This is the legendary Titanic ML competition â€“ the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

2 **House Price prediction**
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

3 **Customer Segmentation** The objective of this task is to find out what the paying spent their money on and to understand these customers. The dataset provided had the names of the customers, their date of birth, transaction amounts, date of transactions, Merchants and category (what category money was spent on). 
A bit of feature engineering was used to create new features. I created the age column (off the d.o.b), the season of the purchases (off the transaction dates) and generation (off the age columns). K-means nearest neighbour was used to segment the dataset based on gender, age, transaction amount, month of purchase and category columns. The silhouette and elbow method was used to pick the number of clusters for the dataset and I arrived at four clusters which I then appended to the dataset which I then used to create the report below.
