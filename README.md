A repo about Kaggle competitions

1..Titanic
This is the legendary Titanic ML competition â€“ the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

2..House Price prediction
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.
